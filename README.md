# Overview

BAS-PRO plotting is a set of Python scripts to plot model solutions generated by the BAS-PRO model.

# Getting started:

1. Clone this repository by typing ```git clone <repo>``` replacing <repo> with the URL (on Github/Gitlab, go to Clone > Clone with HTTPS and copy the link)

2. Optionally, create a new Python virtual environment. Install requirements by running, from the BAS-PRO plotting directory:
- ```pip install --upgrade pip```
- ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` 

3. Generate a template configuration file for the plotting routines. Either using the Python interpreter (type ```python``` to start), or from a Python script, run:
```
import plot
plot.regenerate_template_config()
```

4. A configuration template will be generated in the ```basproplot_configurations``` directory. Rename it to ```example.json``` and modify the template based on the plotting requirements (see guide below).

5. Plots can now be generated from Python. Continuing from step 3., run the below, replacing paths as appropriate:
```
plot.generate_from_config("full_path_to_solution_dir", "basproplot_configurations/example.json") 
```
